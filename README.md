# Amethystbrowse
A browser based on QTWebEngine And PyQT5 made in Python.
I made a web browser, thought i would upload it here to get help from smarter people.

CAN DO:
Basic Web Browsing.
Very Little Else.

CANT DO:
Youtube/More complex pages (testing not finished)
Loads of other stuff.

I plan on trying to get more functionality into it like, caching passwords for password saving, bookmarking, history etc. but im not smart enough yet. feel free to update the code and pull request, if its meaning-full i will merge.
